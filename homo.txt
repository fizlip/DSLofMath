H(eval'', FunExp, FunSem)

eval''(FunExp x y) /= FunSem (eval'' x) (eval'' y)

x = 2
y = 2

eval :: FunExp -> Real
derive :: FunExp -> FunExp

We want to prove that 
    eval'' (x :*: y) /= FunSemAdd (eval'' x) (eval'' y)

is true.

The expression evaluates to
    (x * y)'' /= FunSemMul x'' y''

and so
    (x''y+x'y') + (x'*y'+x*y'') /= x'' * y''

The RHS is obvously not equal to the RHS, the statement is thus proven.
